init    The Unix program which spawns all other processes. As of 2016, for major Linux distributions, it has been replaced by systemd.[2]
biod	Works in cooperation with the remote nfsd to handle client NFS requests.

fingerd	Provides a network interface for the finger protocol, as used by the finger command.
ftpd	Services FTP requests from a remote system.
httpd	Web server daemon.
inetd	Listens for network connection requests. If a request is accepted, it can launch a background daemon to handle the request, was known as the super server for this reason. Some systems use the replacement command xinetd.
lpd	The line printer daemon that manages printer spooling.
nfsd	Processes NFS operation requests from client systems. Historically each nfsd daemon handled one request at a time, so it was normal to start multiple copies.

portmap/rpcbind:	Provides information to allow ONC RPC clients to contact ONC RPC servers
sshd	Listens for secure shell requests from clients.

swapper	Copies process regions to swap space in order to reclaim physical pages of memory for the kernel. Also called sched.

systemd	Replacement of init, the Unix program which spawns all other processes.
